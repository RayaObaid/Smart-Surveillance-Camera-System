# Smart Surveillance Camera System

A real-time smart surveillance system designed to enhance security and efficiency in factories and warehouses by detecting objects, unauthorized human presence, and human emotions for faster threat response.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an intelligent camera system that monitors factory environments continuously, providing immediate detection of potential security threats. The system integrates machine learning and computer vision to ensure timely alerts and improved safety.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Identifies and tracks objects and people within the factory environment.  
- **Unauthorized Access Alerts:** Detects and notifies when unauthorized personnel enter restricted zones.  
- **Emotion Recognition:** Analyzes facial expressions to identify emotions like anger or distress.  
- **User-friendly Interface:** Designed to be easy to operate and integrate with existing security infrastructure.  
- **Data Privacy:** Ensures secure handling of sensitive video and user data.

## Technology Stack

- **Python** — Core programming language for system logic and model integration  
- **OpenCV** — Computer vision for image and video processing  
- **Machine Learning Models** — Object detection and emotion recognition  
- **Other Tools:** (Add any others you used, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
